# Scrum

Scrum is a framework for managing and completing complex projects, often used in conjunction with Agile SDLC. It is based on the principles of transparency, inspection, and adaptation

Scrum is used to manage a project as a series of iterations, called Sprints, which typically last 2 - 4 weeks. During each Sprint, the team works to deliver a potentially releasable product in increments. The team uses a set of Scrum ceremonies to plan, execute, and reflect on the work they are doing.

## Scrum Ceremonies

1. Sprint Planning
    - This is where the team sets goals and plans for the next iteration of the project
2. Daily Scrum
    - A short meeting held every day to discuss progress and plan for the next day
3. Sprint Review
    - Where the team demos what they have built for the customer (or manager)
4. Sprint Retrospective
    - Where the team reflects on what went well and what could be improved in the last iteration

## Story Pointing

Story Pointing is a technique used in Scrum to estimate the complexity of a given task or feature. The team members will gather around to discuss the estimated relative complexity of a particular user story, adn assign a point value to the story.

A user story is essentially a description of a how a user can interact with the product:

- As a user, I should be able to login to the website
- As a user, I should be able to track my created notes
- As a user, I should be able to delete my account

The point value is often represented using the fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, etc) to indicate the relative size of the story.

These ceremonies are used to help keep the team focused and on track. If a team member is unable to continue with their user story due to problems, these are referred to as blockers. Blockers are essentially things that prevent the person from moving on from development. This does not include things like "I can't do it because it is difficult, it should be specific". The blockers can then be assigned other team members to aid in clearing the blocks, or give the user story to another member or another scrum.

## Daily Stand-Ups

A stand-up, or also known as "daily scrum" are meeting desinged to help set the context for the rest of the day. THey are designed to be kept to 15 minute segments and need to be fast and efficient. This keeps discussions short but always relevant.

### Requirements

- Everyone in the team is required to attend and speak
    - Anyone who is not part of the team may show but should only listen
- The meeting are not meant for problem-solving or issue resolution
    - They should be noted and placed on a kanban board (trello) for resolution after the standup
- Each team member must answer the following:
    - What did you do yesterday?
    - What will you do today?
    - Are there any blockers in your way?
    - If a team member says they will complete the database connection in the meeting, tomorrow everyone will expect to hear whether they did or not

> Some typical blockers could be:
> - My ___ broke and I need a new one
> - I need help debugging a problem with ___
> - I'm strugglign to learn ___ and would like to pair with someone on it
> - I can't get the __ group to gfive me any time and I need to meet with them

The final requirement is a Scrum Master to lead each standup and ensure each team member is present and speaking. It should also be their responsibility to resolve the impediments to the best of their ability, and if they cannot then they will work with their team or their manager to help get some resolution.

The Scrum Master is the typically the leader, but that's not always the case. It's up to each team.

### Typical Standup

1. Arrive on time
2. Scrum Master speaks first
    - What did they do yesterday
    - What will they do today
    - Are there any blockers in their way
3. Next person in the order
    - If an order has not been established then during the first standup it should be
4. Once everyone has finished talking, the standup is complete and work can begin
