# Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)

The SDLC is a structured process that helps teams create high-quality software in the shortest possible produciton time. The goal is to match the clients demand to the developers work, in order to create the best possible product for them. SDLC defines and outlines a detailed plan with stages, phases, that encompass their own process and deliverables.

## Why is it important?

- It provides a standardized framework that defines activities and deliverabels
- It aids in project planning, estimating, and scheduling
- It makes projects easier to track and control
- It increases visibility on all aspects of the lifecycle to all stakeholders
- It increases the speed of development
- It improves client relationships
- It decreases project risk
- It decreases project management expenses

## How does it work?

### Planning Phase

THe planning phases encompasses all aspects of project and product management. This typically includes resource allocation, capacity planning, project scheduling, cost estimation, and provisioning.

During the planning phase, the development team collects information from the stakeholders involved in the project. This includes:
    - Customers
    - Sales
    - Internal and external experts
    - Developers

The inputs are then synthesized into a detailed requirements for the desired software.

### Coding Phase

The coding phases includes system design in an IDE. It also includes static code analysis and code review on multiple devices.

### Building Phase

THe building phases takes the code requirements determined earlier and uses those to begin actually building the software

### Testing Phase

THis phases usually occurs during or after the building phase depending on how the team has decided to approach the project. The testing team evaluates the developed product in order to assess whether they meet the requirements specified int he planning phase.

Assessments can include:
    - Functional testing
    - Unit Testing
    - Code Quality Testing
    - Integration Testing
    - System Testing
    - Security Testing
    - Performance Testing
    - Acceptance Testing

### Release Phase

The release phase involves the team packaging, managing, and deploying releases across different environments

### Deploy Phase

In this phase, the software is officially released into the production environment

### Operate Phase

This is where the software is used in the production environment and when you get back the most bugs or issues from client usage.

### Monitor Phase

Various elements of the software is monitored in order to evaluate different things like system performance, user experience, new security vulnerabilites, analysis of bugs or errors in the system.

## What are the SDLC Methodologies

### Waterfall

This is the oldest and simplest, most structured methodology. Each phase depends on the outcome of the previous phase, and all phases are run sequentially. The name comes from the idea of a waterfall, where each phase should flow naturally into each other.

The waterfall methodology is strict and follows a close adherence to a pre-defined plan and a rigid sequence of steps. The process the SDLC phases as you would expect, but each phase must be completed before moving to the next. This makes changes to the project difficult to implement if the phase has already completed, especially retroactive fixes.

Typically, you would use Waterfall when projects have well defined requirements, clear objectives, and a fixed scope. Some examples:

- Governement Projects
- Hospital Software
- Legal systems
- Financial Systems
- Military Projects

- **Advantages**
    - Clear and well-defined process
        - This methodology makes it easy for teams to understand and follow
        - This is beneficial to projects with a large number of stakeholders and for teams that are new to software development
    - Easy to measure progress
        - As it is linear and sequential, it is easy to measure progress at each stage of the project.
        - This is especially useful for management and for showing stakeholders information on the project progress

- **Disadvantages**
    - Inflexible
        - Once a phase is compelte, it is difficult to go back and make changes
        - This can lead to significant delays, cost overruns, and a final product that does not meet the customers needs
    - Difficult in accommodating requirements
        - As it is based on a linear approach, it can be difficult to apply to projects that are complex or have poorly defined requirements
        - This is especially true for projects that require the requirements to be understood at the beginning of the project
    - Inadaptable to Frequent Changes
        - Linear phases in development are difficult to reverse, so any new changes from client demands will be hard to implement

### Agile

Agile is a SDLC methodology that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and rapid iteration. It is based on the agile manifesto, a set of principles for Software Development.

Agile is an iterative process, this means that the process of building software is repeated multiple times, with each iteration building on the previous one. This allows for more flexibility in the development processa nd helps to ensure the final product meets the customers needs.

One key practice is cross-functional teams. This means that team members have a variety of skills and expertise, and are able to work together to deliver the final product. This ensure all aspects of the project is covered, and if a particular feature is difficult then other teams can be brought in easily in agile.

Other Agile Methdologies:

- Kanban
    - Focus on visualizing work, limiting work-in-progress, and making process policies explicit
- XP (Extreme Programming)
    - Focus on software development process, including coding, testing, and design
- Lean
    - Focus on maximizing efficiency and minimizing waste

- **Advantages**
    - Flexibility
        - As it is an iterative process, it allows for more flexibility in the dev process
        - The team can adapt to changes and uncertainity faster
    - Faster Delivery
        - The goal of agile is to deliver a product ASAP
        - We want to get feedback from the client ASAP, and working code is the best way to get feedback
    - Improved Collaboration
        - Agile emphasizes collaboration between team members, which leads to improved communication and a better final product
    - Improved customer satisfaction
        - Agiles goal is to deliver value to the customer in a timely manner
- **Disadvantages**
    - More difficult in planning and budget
        - Due to the iterative process, it can be difficult to predict changes that could happen and to make a plan before even starting
    - Requires Experienced Team Members
        - Agiel needs experience in their team to manage the teams and adapt to frequent changes
    - Challenging for Larger Projects
        - Agile is suited for small to medium size projects, due to its iterative process it can be challenging to implement for a large project with many stakeholders
    - Difficult to Measure Progress
        - As it is iterative, there is no indication on progrss, especially if changes require the process to be restarted
