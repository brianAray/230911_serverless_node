For more information on how to use the `readline`:

- https://nodejs.org/api/readline.html

```javascript
// Import the readline module for handling user input in the console
const readline = require('readline');
const rl = readline.createInterface({
  input: process.stdin, // Read from standard input (keyboard)
  output: process.stdout // Write to standard output (console)
});

rl.on('line', (line) => {
    console.log(line);
});
